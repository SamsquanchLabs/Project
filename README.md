# Project
## A website with a purpose TBD

5/16/18: 
This repo contains a single html file that references a single javascript file. For now we can view this site with a web browser by simply opening up the html file. This means we can practice JavaScript and work on picking server-side frameworks to use for the site.

Once we do server-side work (python, databases, etc) we'll need to host local web servers to develop the site, and we can keep the master branch hosted for free (other than DNS registration) on GitHub.
